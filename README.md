User and Bot Monitor

Electron program for bot and user monitoring. Can be pointed at a .js file, for Discord.js bots, but that's still wonky at best. Token monitoring works fine however, though is lacking in features.

ATTENTION!

To run the run.bat file, you require Node.js and, subsequently, NPM(which comes with Node.js). And running the run.bat file installs Electron, a NPM module required to run this in a dev environment, globally. I'm not sure if global installation is required or not, but until I know otherwise that's what it's gonna do.
