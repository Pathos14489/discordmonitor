# tokenclient
Discord Token Client

Electron program for bot and user monitoring. Can be pointed at a .js file, for Discord.js bots, but that's still wonky at best. Token monitoring works fine however, though is lacking in features.

ATTENTION!

Electron is required to run this. Run "npm start" in the directory to start the dev environment until there's a proper release.
